post,t3_1pgbd8i,t3_1pgbd8i,Should i let myself do things that make me feel sad and anxious to get over it? (existential dread relating to time),Scribbleclouddd,"for context, i have a strong intense existential dread/fear/anxiety related to time passing, especially and specifically about how little time we have and how fast it goes by, ive always hated sayings like ""life your life to the fullest while you have the time"" and etc, because while it is of course true, the pressure and fear that thought puts on you inherently makes it harder to do just that, at least for me. I find it hard to enjoy my time if i keep focusing about just how little time that IS, but if i dont, i may run out or not spend it wisely.. it sucks..

These thoughts and feelings have kind of been around for a long time to an extend but they came back the strongest they have ever been earlier this year, just a month or so before my 21st birthday, id wake up shaking and unable to get back to sleep

i got out of it after roughly a week when instead of trying to keep thinking about it and basically hitting myself where it hurt to try and maybe get over it i let myself be more uplifting and optimistic in my thoughts essentially and basically convince myself it was okay and that i didnt need to be worrying..

the thoughts still stuck with me to an extend, of course, but it was never to a degree that SERIOUSLY bothered me or impacted my ability to enjoy my life like before.

this feeling came back again last month, subsided again, then came back this month

Read here for the actual question!

When i am in these states, my mind feels very vulnerable, like any tiny thing that even hints as anything that can relate to this fear can be very very painful and make me slip back into feeling very awful for an extended time

ppl say you have to like face your fear if you have irrational anxieties and just go through it and realize youre fine after to get thru them but does that also apply if its not just anxiety but its also just like existential dread and like depression (as in deep sadness and worry and pain not clinical depression)

im just asking because im like worried about making it ""worse"" or something

so is it like good or bad if i let myself go through things that make me feel existential fear and sadness

currently these are things like:planning my day making sure i get in bed punctually/earlythinking about how much time i have in the day and for different things i do in the day thinking about anything related to time passing in general

instead of comforting myself and letting myself do things that lessen that feeling?

currentlytheseare things likeletting myself stay up a little longernot thinking about time and stufftrying to tell myself i still have enough time to do other things before bedletting myself do whatever feels the most comforting and least painful in general when im feeling bad instead of what would be ""ideal""

the latter has been the most helpful with helping the feeling, like in the beginning of the year and the beginning of last month, but it came back later in the year and early in this month so maybe its bad to do in the long term? idk im just worried if i make myself feel this strong emotional pain too much it will like- stick in my brain or something and i wont be able to be free of it anymore but i also worry if i avoid it it will just keep coming back",3240,1,0,True,,2025-12-07T06:22:57.528000+0000,r/mentalhealth,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pgbd8i/should_i_let_myself_do_things_that_make_me_feel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pgbd8i/should_i_let_myself_do_things_that_make_me_feel/

The thought that i dont have enough time left in the day to do what i want to really digs at that fear of one day realizing i dont have enough time left in my life to do what i want to do, and thats terrifying.

Constantly measuring your day, tracking time, and overthinking every minute isn’t wisdom  it’s you giving anxiety a full-time job. You don’t need more analysis. You need to stop micromanaging existence. Do what actually calms you, not what fits some imaginary “ideal lifestyle.” Letting yourself live like a human instead of a stopwatch isn’t weakness  it’s the only reason you felt better before.

These thoughts and feelings have kind of been around for a long time to an extend but they came back the strongest they have ever been earlier this year, just a month or so before my 21st birthday, id wake up shaking and unable to get back to sleep

i got out of it after roughly a week when instead of trying to keep thinking about it and basically hitting myself where it hurt to try and maybe get over it i let myself be more uplifting and optimistic in my thoughts essentially and basically convince myself it was okay and that i didnt need to be worrying..

the thoughts still stuck with me to an extend, of course, but it was never to a degree that SERIOUSLY bothered me or impacted my ability to enjoy my life like before.

im just asking because im like worried about making it ""worse"" or something

so is it like good or bad if i let myself go through things that make me feel existential fear and sadness

(existential dread relating to time),Scribbleclouddd,"for context, i have a strong intense existential dread/fear/anxiety related to time passing, especially and specifically about how little time we have and how fast it goes by, ive always hated sayings like ""life your life to the fullest while you have the time"" and etc, because while it is of course true, the pressure and fear that thought puts on you inherently makes it harder to do just that, at least for me. I find it hard to enjoy my time if i keep focusing about just how little time that IS, but if i dont, i may run out or not spend it wisely.. it sucks..

These thoughts and feelings have kind of been around for a long time to an extend but they came back the strongest they have ever been earlier this year, just a month or so before my 21st birthday, id wake up shaking and unable to get back to sleep

i got out of it after roughly a week when instead of trying to keep thinking about it and basically hitting myself where it hurt to try and maybe get over it i let myself be more uplifting and optimistic in my thoughts essentially and basically convince myself it was okay and that i didnt need to be worrying..

the thoughts still stuck with me to an extend, of course, but it was never to a degree that SERIOUSLY bothered me or impacted my ability to enjoy my life like before.

this feeling came back again last month, subsided again, then came back this month

Read here for the actual question!

When i am in these states, my mind feels very vulnerable, like any tiny thing that even hints as anything that can relate to this fear can be very very painful and make me slip back into feeling very awful for an extended time

ppl say you have to like face your fear if you have irrational anxieties and just go through it and realize youre fine after to get thru them but does that also apply if its not just anxiety but its also just like existential dread and like depression (as in deep sadness and worry and pain not clinical depression)

im just asking because im like worried about making it ""worse"" or something

so is it like good or bad if i let myself go through things that make me feel existential fear and sadness

currently these are things like:planning my day making sure i get in bed punctually/earlythinking about how much time i have in the day and for different things i do in the day thinking about anything related to time passing in general

instead of comforting myself and letting myself do things that lessen that feeling?

currentlytheseare things likeletting myself stay up a little longernot thinking about time and stufftrying to tell myself i still have enough time to do other things before bedletting myself do whatever feels the most comforting and least painful in general when im feeling bad instead of what would be ""ideal""

the latter has been the most helpful with helping the feeling, like in the beginning of the year and the beginning of last month, but it came back later in the year and early in this month so maybe its bad to do in the long term? idk im just worried if i make myself feel this strong emotional pain too much it will like- stick in my brain or something and i wont be able to be free of it anymore but i also worry if i avoid it it will just keep coming back",3240,5,0,True,,2025-12-07T06:22:57.528000+0000,r/mentalhealth,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pgbd8i/should_i_let_myself_do_things_that_make_me_feel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pgbd8i/should_i_let_myself_do_things_that_make_me_feel/

(existential dread relating to time),Realistic-Ice-9714,"honestly, You’re not having some deep philosophical crisis you’re obsessing yourself into misery over a normal fact of life. Everyone knows time passes fast. Most people accept it and keep living. You, on the other hand, keep poking the wound and wondering why it hurts. You’re not “facing your fear,” you’re feeding it. Constantly measuring your day, tracking time, and overthinking every minute isn’t wisdom  it’s you giving anxiety a full-time job. You don’t need more analysis. You need to stop micromanaging existence.

post,t3_1pgbd8i_syn0rnu,t3_1pgbd8i_synjjq,Should i let myself do things that make me feel sad and anxious to get over it? (existential dread relating to time),Scribbleclouddd,"for context, i have a strong intense existential dread/fear/anxiety related to time passing, especially and specifically about how little time we have and how fast it goes by, ive always hated sayings like ""life your life to the fullest while you have the time"" and etc, because while it is of course true, the pressure and fear that thought puts on you inherently makes it harder to do just that, at least for me. I find it hard to enjoy my time if i keep focusing about just how little time that IS, but if i dont, i may run out or not spend it wisely.. it sucks..

These thoughts and feelings have kind of been around for a long time to an extend but they came back the strongest they have ever been earlier this year, just a month or so before my 21st birthday, id wake up shaking and unable to get back to sleep

i got out of it after roughly a week when instead of trying to keep thinking about it and basically hitting myself where it hurt to try and maybe get over it i let myself be more uplifting and optimistic in my thoughts essentially and basically convince myself it was okay and that i didnt need to be worrying..

the thoughts still stuck with me to an extend, of course, but it was never to a degree that SERIOUSLY bothered me or impacted my ability to enjoy my life like before.

this feeling came back again last month, subsided again, then came back this month

Read here for the actual question!

When i am in these states, my mind feels very vulnerable, like any tiny thing that even hints as anything that can relate to this fear can be very very painful and make me slip back into feeling very awful for an extended time

ppl say you have to like face your fear if you have irrational anxieties and just go through it and realize youre fine after to get thru them but does that also apply if its not just anxiety but its also just like existential dread and like depression (as in deep sadness and worry and pain not clinical depression)

im just asking because im like worried about making it ""worse"" or something

so is it like good or bad if i let myself go through things that make me feel existential fear and sadness

currently these are things like:planning my day making sure i get in bed punctually/earlythinking about how much time i have in the day and for different things i do in the day thinking about anything related to time passing in general

instead of comforting myself and letting myself do things that lessen that feeling?

currentlytheseare things likeletting myself stay up a little longernot thinking about time and stufftrying to tell myself i still have enough time to do other things before bedletting myself do whatever feels the most comforting and least painful in general when im feeling bad instead of what would be ""ideal""

the latter has been the most helpful with helping the feeling, like in the beginning of the year and the beginning of last month, but it came back later in the year and early in this month so maybe its bad to do in the long term? idk im just worried if i make myself feel this strong emotional pain too much it will like- stick in my brain or something and i wont be able to be free of it anymore but i also worry if i avoid it it will just keep coming back any advice would be appreciated.",3273,3,1,True,,2025-12-07T06:22:57.528000+0000,r/mentalhealth,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pgbd8i/should_i_let_myself_do_things_that_make_me_feel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pgbd8i/should_i_let_myself_do_things_that_make_me_feel/
