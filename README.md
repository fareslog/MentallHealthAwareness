# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project applies the **CRISP-DM methodology** to analyze and predict mental health conditions based on survey and demographic data.  
It explores how data-driven models can help identify risk factors, segment populations, and provide recommendations to support early detection and awareness of mental health challenges.

## 🎯 Objectives  

### 🏢 Business Objectives  
- **Prevention**: Identify individuals at risk of psychological disorders for early intervention.  
- **Resource Optimization**: Support better targeting of awareness programs.  
- **Well-being Improvement**: Provide personalized recommendations to improve lifestyle and reduce risks.  

### 🤖 Data Science Objectives  
- **Prediction**: Build machine learning models to classify individuals at risk of mental health conditions.  
- **Segmentation**: Use clustering to identify distinct profiles (e.g., students vs employees, high vs low stress).  
- **Recommendation**: Suggest preventive actions (consultation, sleep management, awareness campaigns) based on identified profiles.

## 📊 Features (Planned Work)  
- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics, correlation heatmaps, boxplots, anomaly detection.  
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost for classification; K-means for clustering.  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (for prediction); Silhouette score (for clustering).  
- **Recommendation**: Profile-based suggestions using insights from clustering.
