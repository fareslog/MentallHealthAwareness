# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict mental health conditions based on survey and demographic data. The goal is to explore how data-driven models can help identify risk factors, raise awareness, and support early detection of mental health challenges.

## 📌 Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of the **Mental Health Dataset**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights  
- Implementation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization  
- Prediction pipeline for new unseen data  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
- Understand correlations between mental health conditions and lifestyle/workplace factors  
- Build predictive models to assist in **early identification** of mental health risks  
- Provide a baseline for integrating AI into **mental health awareness and prevention tools**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for data visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
