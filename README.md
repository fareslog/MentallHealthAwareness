🧠 Mental Health Analysis & Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies the CRISP-DM methodology to analyze and predict mental health conditions based on survey and demographic data.
It explores how data-driven models can help identify risk factors, segment populations, and provide recommendations to support early detection and awareness of mental health challenges.

📌 Project Scope (from Cahier des Charges)

Business Understanding: Mental health is a major social issue affecting productivity and well-being. The project aims to identify risk factors, segment populations by psychological profiles, and provide data-driven recommendations.

Data Understanding: Dataset from Kaggle – Mental Health Dataset
, including demographics, lifestyle factors, and psychological indicators.

🎯 Objectives
Business Objectives

Prevention: Identify individuals at risk of psychological disorders for early intervention.

Resource Optimization: Support better targeting of awareness programs.

Well-being Improvement: Provide personalized recommendations to improve lifestyle and reduce risks.

Data Science Objectives

Prediction: Build machine learning models to classify individuals at risk of mental health conditions.

Segmentation: Use clustering to identify distinct profiles (e.g., students vs employees, high vs low stress).

Recommendation: Suggest preventive actions (consultation, sleep management, awareness campaigns) based on identified profiles.

📊 Features (Planned Work)

Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics, correlation heatmaps, boxplots, anomaly detection.

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost for classification; K-means for clustering.

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (for prediction); Silhouette score (for clustering).

Recommendation: Profile-based suggestions using insights from clustering.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🚀 Future Improvements

Integration of deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) for more complex predictions.

Deployment as a web application (Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit).

User-friendly dashboards for mental health awareness and prevention.
